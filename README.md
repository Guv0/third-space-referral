Each email entered in the form saves to a database. Usually, each referral would reference a user, however there is no user model as I didn't think this would be expected as part of this task.

Given a little more time I could also have implemented a mailing system by which all emails entered for referral would recieve an email from third space. Although I am sure you already have your own mailing system in place.

I didn't get time to implement logic to enter more than one email address before submitting.

Styling of all the page content pretty much complete - I would just make small tweeks if more time and obviously the assets such as font etc.
